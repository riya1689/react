1. What is Firebase?

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform developed by Google.
It provides a set of tools and cloud services that help developers build, manage, and scale web and mobile applications ‚Äî without managing servers.
It includes databases, authentication, hosting, cloud storage, push notifications, and analytics.

2. Is Firebase frontend or backend?

Firebase is mainly a backend service.
However, it provides SDKs and APIs that can be directly integrated into frontend apps (web, Android, iOS), so developers don‚Äôt need to write separate backend code.
üëâ In short: Frontend developers use Firebase for backend features.

3. What is Firebase architecture?

Firebase architecture is client-server-based, where:

Client (Frontend): App (web or mobile) directly communicates with Firebase SDK.

Firebase Backend (Cloud Services): Handles data storage, authentication, hosting, etc.

Google Cloud Infrastructure: Underlying layer that powers Firebase.

Layers:

Frontend (User App) ‚Üí uses Firebase SDK

Firebase Services (Auth, Firestore, Storage, etc.)

Google Cloud Platform (real backend & infrastructure)

4. What are the features of Firebase? What tasks can you accomplish with it?

Main Features:

Firebase Authentication ‚Üí Login with email/password, Google, GitHub, etc.

Cloud Firestore / Realtime Database ‚Üí Store and sync data.

Firebase Hosting ‚Üí Host static websites and web apps.

Firebase Cloud Storage ‚Üí Store files like images or videos.

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) ‚Üí Send push notifications.

Firebase Analytics ‚Üí Track user behavior and app performance.

Firebase Functions ‚Üí Run backend code in the cloud.

Tasks you can accomplish:

User authentication

Data storage and syncing in real time

File uploading and hosting

Sending push notifications

Deploying web apps easily

5. Difference between Firebase and MongoDB
Feature	Firebase	MongoDB
Type	Backend-as-a-Service	Database only
Data Model	JSON tree (Realtime DB) or NoSQL collections (Firestore)	NoSQL documents & collections
Hosting	Provided by Google	Self-hosted or MongoDB Atlas
Real-time Sync	Built-in	Not real-time (requires additional setup)
Authentication	Built-in	Requires external setup
Use Case	For quick app setup, small to medium projects	For large, complex, custom backends
6. Have you ever used Firebase Database (Realtime Database)?

‚úÖ Yes (if you have used it)
For example:

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve used Firebase Realtime Database in my projects to store and update data instantly across all clients. It‚Äôs useful for chat apps, live updates, and collaborative features because of real-time synchronization.‚Äù

7. Can you briefly explain the GitHub authentication process with Firebase?

Sure:

Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method ‚Üí GitHub.

Enable GitHub provider and add Client ID and Client Secret from your GitHub Developer settings.

In your frontend app, call:

const provider = new GithubAuthProvider();
signInWithPopup(auth, provider);


Firebase handles OAuth flow and returns user info (name, email, GitHub ID).

You can then store user data in Firestore or use it for authorization.

8. Which method is used to sign in user in Firebase Email/Password Authentication?

The method is:

signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)


It verifies the credentials and returns a user object on success.

9. Authentication vs Authorization
Term	Meaning	Example
Authentication	Verifies who the user is	Logging in with email & password
Authorization	Decides what the user can access	Admin can edit data; user can only view
10. Can you tell me names of 3 authentication methods?

Email & Password Authentication

Google Sign-In

GitHub / Facebook / Phone Number Authentication

11. Which authentication methods have you ever used for your project purpose?

Example answer:

‚ÄúIn my projects, I‚Äôve used Email & Password authentication and Google Sign-In. I‚Äôve also experimented with GitHub authentication for developer-oriented apps.‚Äù
