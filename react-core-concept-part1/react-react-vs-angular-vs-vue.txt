React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (developed by Facebook).

Used in React Applications, Web Applications, and Mobile App Development (via React Native).

in its ecosystem.
React – Core Features

Language: JavaScript + JSX (JavaScript XML for templating).

Rendering: Virtual DOM → updates only changed parts → faster.

Data Binding: One-way (unidirectional).

Structure: Component-based → reusable & scalable.

Ecosystem: Relies on third-party libraries (e.g., React Router for navigation, Redux Toolkit for state management).

Developer Experience: Hot Reload plugin → instant updates.

Flexibility: Not a full framework → you choose tools based on project needs.

react -> js library for building user interface
React → Library, fast & flexible, but needs third-party tools.

Best For: Flexible projects needing speed, performance, and strong third-party ecosystem.

Angular

A complete MVC framework for front-end development (developed by Google).

Comes with built-in tools: Routing, State Management, HTTP, etc.

Angular – Core Features

Language: TypeScript (superset of JavaScript).

Rendering: Real DOM (slower compared to Virtual DOM in very large apps).

Data Binding: Two-way (bi-directional flow between model & view).

Structure: Full MVC framework → routing, HTTP, forms, and state management are built-in.

Ecosystem: No heavy reliance on third-party libraries; provides official tools.

Developer Experience: Angular CLI → simplifies setup, testing & scaling.

Stability: Opinionated and structured → great for enterprise-level apps.

Best For: Enterprise-level apps where a complete, opinionated framework is ideal.

Vue (by Evan You, ex-Google)

Type: Progressive framework → lightweight, flexible, and incrementally adaptable.

Language: JavaScript (with templates). Supports TypeScript optionally.

Rendering: Virtual DOM (like React) → efficient updates.

Data Binding: Two-way (like Angular), but optional.

Structure: Progressive framework → can start small and scale up.

Ecosystem: Official libraries available (Vue Router, Vuex for state management) → less reliance on third-party tools than React.

Developer Experience: Vue CLI and Vue DevTools → quick setup & debugging.

Flexibility: Lightweight and beginner-friendly → combines best of React & Angular.

Best For: Small-to-medium apps, startups, or when quick development + easy adoption is needed.

Key Distinction:

React → Library, fast & flexible, but needs third-party tools.

Angular → Complete framework, everything built-in, best for enterprises.

Vue → Progressive, lightweight, balanced approach (official tools + flexibility).



declarative, efficient and flexible




fast and component based , very fast
devloped by facebook

reusable

create virtuall dom -> faster work

hot reload plug in


redux tool

react native

react fiber open source engine

roadmap.assets


angular is full framework    react is a js library(smaller piece).it has more collection ,but need to attach with this

angular is complete MVC framework for front end development

react is responsible for view element in model view controller framework

JSX (java script XML) template used by React JS 
angular uses template base on advance HTML

comoponent

Virtual  DOM used by React
data biinding
react support undirectional data biinding.one way

angular data binding is bi directional.two way flow data between model and view


scalability

when to use react 
react use extra third party tools and supporting integrations externel to reactjs

angular includes additonal tools like routing,state management,HTTPS which can build large scale apps 


react is not full scale frame work.using react means have to use third party community-managed modules for routing

when to use angular

angular CLI is helpful

data flow is simple and easy.because its bi directioanl
