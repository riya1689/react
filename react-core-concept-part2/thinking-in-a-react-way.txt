when building user interface with React -

1: break it apart into pieces called components.

step 2: Describing the different visual states for each of states for of the components.

step 3: connect the component together so that the data flows though them.

think about -> programming , CSS, Design


states
1.Does it remain unchanged over time?If so, it isnt state.
2.Is it passed in from a perent via props? If so, it isnt state
3.can you complete it based on existing state or props in yoour component?If so, it definitely isnt state.

where should state/ data go?

where state live?

how to send state

1.List of products - passed in as props , so its not state.
2. The search text - Its state since it changes over time
3.The value of checkbox - its state since it changes over time
4.The filtered list of products - not state


Clear concept

1.how to work event trigger?
2.How to deal state while trigger event?
3.data load api dynamically
4.loop through to display data
5.why we use key props
