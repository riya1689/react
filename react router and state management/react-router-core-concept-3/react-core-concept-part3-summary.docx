form use in react application

custom hook

prop drilling - bye bye

event handler in form and data access

data from form and kept it in state, set default value

reusable component, prop drilling

context api



1. e.target.[name of the input field].value
2.  use form action formData and Controlled Component.
use form action and formData in the action handler, formData.get('name of the input field)

3.controlled component, use state on change of the field..useful to dynamically handle error  

4.uncontrolled using useRef (building hook)  -> keeps DOM's reference -> current property

5.Hook Form


pitfall

custom hook, functional component, (kono loop, condition e use kora jabe na)


6. Display form data in a table and form error handle
mutable -> changeable


7.family component tree structure
